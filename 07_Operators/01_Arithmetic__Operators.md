# Arithmetic Operations in Python

## Introduction

Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values. These operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## List of Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (+):** Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
3. **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (/):** Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
5. **Floor Division (//):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
6. **Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
7. **Exponentiation (**):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

## Examples

### Addition

```python
num1 = 7
num2 = 5
result = num1 + num2
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

### Subtraction

```python
num3 = 7
num4 = 5
result = num3 - num4
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
### Exercise

Create two variables a and b with numeric values.
Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.
Print the results.

```python
a = 7
b = 5

sum_result = a + b
difference_result = a - b
product_result = a * b
quotient_result = a / b

print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Quotient:", quotient_result)
```
